**Notes**
->This is another conversion Exercise I was assigned
->All the elements as depicted in the psd design are included in the Html file.
-> You can view the original psd & jpeg file in main directory.
->The styles are saved in 'assets/css/style.css' file.
->The images used are stored in'assets/images' folder.
->I have used Bootstrap framework & Google Map Api.
->Also, I have made the Design as responsive as possible & is viewable in any size window(Desktop,tablet & Mobile). (Browser Recommended:Firefox)
->The hover effects are also added in the nav element.
->Further comments are also included within the files.

!important: Internet is required to load Bootstrap framework & access Google Map Api.

P.S: I know the navbar is not much responsive, I Htmlise in hurry & tried to make it exact as in the provided psd file. Please ignore that if possible for now, I will fix that later. 
TY :D
