**Notes:-**
<ul>
  <li>This is another conversion Exercise I was assigned</li>
<li>All the elements as depicted in the psd design are included in the Html file.</li>
<li>You can view the original psd & jpeg file in main directory.</li>
<li>The styles are saved in 'assets/css/style.css' file.</li>
<li>The images used are stored in'assets/images' folder.</li>
<li>I have used Bootstrap framework & Google Map Api.</li>
<li>Also, I have made the Design as responsive as possible & is viewable in any size window(Desktop,tablet & Mobile). (Browser Recommended:Firefox)</li>
<li>The hover effects are also added in the nav element.</li>
<li>Further comments are also included within the files.</li>
</ul>

**Important: Internet is required to load Bootstrap framework & access Google Map Api.**

**P.S:** I know the navbar is not much responsive, I did Html Coding in hurry & tried to make it exact as in the provided psd file. Please ignore that if possible for now, I will fix that later. 
TY :D
